              <p><em>
                The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?
              </em></p>
              <br>
              <p>Working off the numerical theory that all positive integers are made up of some number of prime factors, we can simplify any number down to its largest prime by first dividing it down starting from its smaller prime factors. We set the range appropriately depending on how large we may think the max prime is (should not be too large, but we can adjust accordingly). As we loop through, if it turns out our number is divisible at the current iteration, it will continue to divide and set itself as the new quotient until no longer divisible, where it then moves on to the next iteration (next integer). We do this until our original <code>num</code> reaches either 1 or itself, which means we've encountered the largest prime product. As a side note, if we wanted to find <em>all</em> of the prime factors (including the multiples of each one), we'd simply have to implement a count at each iteration and add to a data structure such a dictionary to keep track. This solution, although fast, runs in O(n) and is not the most efficient algorithm.</p>
              <pre><code>def euler3():
    num = 600851475143  # set the number to num
    for i in range(2,100000):  # assume the max prime < 100000; change if test fails
        while num % i == 0:  # test if divisible by i
            num //= i  # if it is prime, divide num by this prime and continue
            if num == 1 or num == i:  # if 1 or self-divisible: return i

              <p>No choice here but to brute force through the products of two 3-digit numbers.

              <p><em>
                2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
              </em></p>
              <br>
              <p>Although tempted to simply start at 20 and increment by 20 in a while loop and check each number for divisibility requirements, this is not the most efficient solution. In fact, using this type of approach would take a hefty 12 seconds for the program to output an answer. Instead, we look at the problem and realize that the beginning integer must be the product of all the primes under 20, since those primes can multiply to create any integer under 20. This means that as long the number is divisible by all the primes under 20, it will be divisible by all the numbers under 20 (for example, if a number is divisible by 18, it must mean it is divisible by 9 and 2). Thus, we set our <code>i</code> to be 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 = 9699690. We check its divisibility for [1, 20] and if it is not satisfied, we increment by another 9699690.</p>
              <pre><code>def euler5():
    i = 9699690
    while True:
        if all(i % j == 0 for j in range(1,21)):  # tests to see if this number is evenly divisible by 1-20
            return i
        else:
            i += 9699690</code></pre>

              <p><em>
                By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13. What is the 10001st prime number?
              </em></p>
              <br>
              <p>One method of tackling this problem is simply looping through until we hit the 10001st prime (brute force). The other method is as follows: keep a list of all the primes found starting from 2 and loop indefinitely until we reach a number that is not divisible by any of the numbers within the prime list. If that happens, add that number to the prime list because it must be prime (since all composite numbers are made up of some number of primes). Furthermore, instead of checking through the whole prime list to see if that number is prime, we can check to see if the square root of the unknown number is less than the current prime iteration, i.e., the unknown number is less than the prime squared, which will cut down our search time.</p>

              <p>We take an approach to this problem that isn't obvious at first glance. We know that all composite numbers are made up of some multiple or other of primes numbers. This means that all prime numbers must only have two factors at most, so we're searching for the first composite number with more than 500 factors. We are able to calculate the number of factors for any integer by multiplying the powers of each prime factor added by one. For example, we have that the number 196 is made up of two 2s and two 7s (2<sup>2</sup> + 7<sup>2</sup> = 196). We take the two exponents in the factors (2 and 2), add one to each (now becomes 3 and 3), and multiply to get 3 * 3 = 9. This means that 196 has a total of 9 different factors (which, by the way, are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, and 196). Thus, our program will firstly have to find some primes numbers, and then reduce a given intger by prime factorization, and then calculate the total number of factors in order to receive our answer.</p>
